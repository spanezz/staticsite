# Page

`Page` objects are the base for all elements in the site. Different content is
loaded with different instances of `Page`, like `Asset`, `Image`, and
`MarkdownPage`.

## `meta`

Dictionary with all the [metadata](metadata.md) collected for the page or resource.

You can inspect this using the `ssite dump_meta` command.


## `find_pages(â€¦)`

Find resources in the site relative to the current page.

The full signature is:

```py
Page.find_pages(
            path: Optional[str] = None,
            limit: Optional[int] = None,
            sort: Optional[str] = None,
            root: Optional[str] = None,
            **kw) -> List[Page]
```

See [page filter documentation](page-filter.md) for details.


## `resolve_path(target: Union[str, Page]) -> Page`

Find a page by path, relative to the current page.

If target is already a `Page`, it is returned as-is.


## `url_for(target: Union[str, "Page"], absolute=False) -> str`

Return a URL that can be used in this page to link to `target`.

Set `absolute=True` to force it to be an absolute URL.


## `html_body() -> str`

Render the full body of the page, with UI elements excluding
navigation, headers, footers.

This is used when rendering the page itself, when the theme is doing the UI and
the page needs to render its contents via Markdown or reStructuredText.


## `html_inline() -> str`

Render the content of the page to be shown inline, like in a blog page.

For pages with a leading introduction, the rest of the content is not shown.

Small images are used by default.

No UI elements are used if possible.


## `html_feed() -> str`

Render the content of the page to be shown in a RSS/Atom feed.

The whole contents are shown, without UI elements. All local links are rendered
as absolute URLs
