# syndication_date: Syndication date for this page.

This is the date that will appear in RSS and Atom feeds, and the page will not
be syndicated before this date.

Use this field to publish a date today but make it appear in
syndication only at some point in the future.

If a page is syndicated and `syndication_date` is missing, it defaults to `date`.
